# Data_Engineering_Project

## OVERVIEW
The project is about creating data pipelines to extract and transform data from the federal housing department and economics API to store data in the data warehouse (Big Query). Designed data pipelines and automated tasks using Apache Airflow to extract and transform data. To store data in Big Query and provide data visualization of the datasets.

INSIGHTS:
HOUSING PRICE RISES HAVE A STRONG CORRELATION WITH CPI AND GDP AT 0.94
INFLATION AND INDEX_SA SOMEWHAT CORRELATE WITH HPI AT (0.34)
UNEMPLOYMENT HAS NEGATIVE CORRELATION WITH HPI AND CPI

## CONCLUSION
We expected HPI to grow in a solid positive trend along with CPI and GDP. Salt Lake's HPI and Utah's HPI, in general, are much higher than the national average HPI. The Utah housing market continues to grow steadily over the year and is expected to maintain a higher level than the national average. Unemployment has no effect on the HPI and CPI rise or fall. We can use the economic indicators to predict the HPI trend.
